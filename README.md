# 🤖 Emotion Detection Using FER-2013 Dataset

Welcome to the **Emotion Detection** project! This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of an emotion detection model using the **FER-2013 dataset**. The project is built with a focus on **PyTorch-Lightning** and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 📚 Project Overview

The **FER-2013 dataset** is a gray-scale image dataset of faces categorized into seven emotion classes:
1. Happiness 😊  
2. Neutral 😐  
3. Sadness
4. Anger
5. Surprise
6. Disgust
7. Fear

The dataset consists of **35,685 examples**, each 48x48 pixels in size, split into training and testing sets. The aim is to train a deep learning model to classify these emotions accurately.
